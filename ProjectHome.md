ASTrans allows automatically generating a textual DSL
infrastructure concentrating on the target meta-model, not the concrete syntax.

We understand that no concrete syntax might be developed without a grammar, but the grammar should not be the processâ€™s entry point and the main determining artifact, but the target meta-model should.
